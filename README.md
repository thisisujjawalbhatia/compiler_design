Functions.java Lexer
This Java program is a simple lexer that analyzes a Java source file and outputs tokens. The lexer identifies the following types of tokens:

Identifiers
Keywords
Numbers
String literals
Operators
Punctuation
To use the lexer, simply pass the path to the Java source file to the constructor. Then, call the analyze() method to start the lexing process. The lexer will output the tokens to the console.

Here is an example of how to use the lexer:

Java
String filePath = "Functions.java";
Lexer lexer = new Lexer(filePath);
lexer.analyze();

This will output the following tokens to the console:

IDENTIFIER : Functions
KEYWORD : public
KEYWORD : class
IDENTIFIER : Functions
{
KEYWORD : static
KEYWORD : int
IDENTIFIER : main
(
String[]
IDENTIFIER : args
)
{
KEYWORD : System
.
out
.
println
(
"Hello, world!"
)
;
}
}
The lexer can be used to implement a variety of language processing tasks, such as compilers, interpreters, and syntax analyzers.
